## Why the name change from ZipTie to Xerela? ##

The ZipTie trademark is owned by AlterPoint.  AlterPoint used this trademark until at least October 2008, and the statutory period for prima facie evidence of abandonment is three years.

## I worked for AlterPoint -- can I contribute? ##

That depends on your particular employment agreement and how long it's been since you left AlterPoint.  If you have any doubts you should talk to a lawyer.  You should be aware that Trilogy/Versata has a history of suing former employees for violation of non-compete agreements.  _Trilogy Software v. Callidus Software_, 143 S.W.3d 452 (2004).  For your own sake and for the sake of this project, please do not get involved or contribute if there's any chance doing so would violate any contractual obligation you have to AlterPoint.

## Why recreate all the project documentation instead of just copying it over from ZipTie / NetworkAuthority Inventory? ##

Though the ZipTie source code was released under the MPL until October 2008, it's not clear that the same is true for the ZipTie documentation, especially since most if not all of the documentation was written by AlterPoint employees.  As far as I can tell, the copyright for all of the documentation is owned by AlterPoint and cannot be copied or distributed without a license.  If you have any reason to suspect otherwise, please comment below.
