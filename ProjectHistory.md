# A Brief History from ZipTie to Xerela #

ZipTie was an open source NCCM project launched by AlterPoint in November 2006. AlterPoint sponsored the project with several full-time developers until early October 2008, when those developers -- as well as many other AP employees -- were laid off.  Several weeks later the ZipTie license was changed from the MPL to a proprietary license and ZipTie was rebranded by AlterPoint as "NetworkAuthority Inventory".

Xerela is, as far as I know, the first fork of one of the last MPL checkouts of ZipTie created with the goal of reviving it as an active, bona fide open source project.

There is no longer a corporate sponsor of ~~ZipTie~~ Xerela, so the success of the project depends entirely on the participation of the community.
